# ComboPractice
I'll try to combine stuff I've learned in schooland do somethings i've only read or heard about.

build and run Universerver, then build and run anynumber of clients

you can send messages from client to server, it doesnt show yet but they do arrive.
the server will then fill up your memory sending messages to itself... but i'm working on that...
